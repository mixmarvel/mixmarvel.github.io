In  July 2019, MixMarvel launched the decentralized community admin program, Recruiting admins globally to manage MixMarvel community. 

Admins actively involved in MixMarvel communities and social channels, helping users to fully understand the MixMarvel project, play MixMarvel games and participate in MixMarvel activities.
