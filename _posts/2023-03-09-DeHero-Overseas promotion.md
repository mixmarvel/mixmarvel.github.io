MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in February 2023, MixMarvel has collaborated with DeHeroGame and launched a pre-launch airdrop event.

DeHeroGame is the latest iteration of the “staking card game” following DeHero, a BNB-based GameFi 1.0 application that innovated the concept of Staking Card Game and achieved great success among Web3 gamers. Incubated by MixMarvel, the new project made a successful beta test last September and is now set to be released in the coming days.

MixMarvel, with its deep understanding of the blockchain game industry, aggregated resources and has achieved success with DeHeroGame. A series of marketing promotions were conducted so that the product could be very popular all over the world. 

To celebrate the official release of the new project and to give back to community, MixMarvel has collaborated with DeHeroGame and launched a pre-launch airdrop event, in which all $MIX token holders are eligible for various DeHeroGame asset rewards.

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem. MixMarvel emphasizes on both supporting third-party games to transform into blockchain games and developing its own games. 

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this project. The funds will include but not limited to: technical assistance, operation and publishing costs 16,866,688.29 MIX Tokens in total.
