On 31st July, 2019, MixMarvel started a one-week Game User Conversion Event. The user signed in for 5 days and played the game "Medusa's Wrath" three times, and submits the address to get a reward of 30MIX. This airdrop will give rewards to 1000 people.

The MixMarvel Kakao Community Game User Conversion Event was successful and reached the goal of increasing MixMarvel Kakao community game users and boosting social channels activities.

The MixMarvel Foundation has a 600,000 cumulative back-up funding support for the community development in the form of MixMarvel Kakao Community Game User Conversion Event.
