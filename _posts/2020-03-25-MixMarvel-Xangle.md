MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in March 2020, the MixMarvel will collaborate with blockchain project information disclosure platform Xangle to  public due diligence report.

On March 25, 2020, MixMarvel started a comprehensive collaboration with Xangle. MixMarvel discloses Information on Xangle to Provide Exchanges and Token buyers with Due Diligence Reports.

MixMarvel believes that information disclosure is key to protecting the buyers: it is important that the crypto market makes its transition from today’s speculative environment to a more rational and legitimate one. By practicing disclosure on Xangle, we are tackling information distortion, to ensure that buyers have what they need to make informed decisions.

As a part of this partnership, MixMarvel went through a strict due diligence process by Xangle to publish a due diligence report that will be made available to Xangle’s partner exchanges. Exchanges will have access to this regularly updated institutional grade report to perform continued evaluation of projects before and while they are listed. 

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this collaboration. The funds will include but not limited to: marketing, event organization, community construction, PR, etc. 120,000 MIX Tokens in total.
