In December 2018, MixMarvel launched the decentralized community admin program, Recruiting admins globally to manage MixMarvel community. 

Admins actively involved in MixMarvel communities and social channels, helping users to fully understand the MixMarvel project, play MixMarvel games and participate in MixMarvel activities. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of decentralized admin program. Admins who come from different countries will contribute different voices to MixMarvel that will help MixMarvel improve.
