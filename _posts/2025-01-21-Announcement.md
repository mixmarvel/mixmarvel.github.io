MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in January 21 2025, MixMarvel Foundation officially announced that it will initiate a $MIX token buyback program with revenue generated from its ecosystem. 

MixMarvel will allocate 30% of the ecosystem revenue each month for the buyback of $MIX tokens. The repurchased $MIX tokens will be allocated as follows: 70% will be incorporated into the Treasury to support future ecosystem development, while the remaining 30% will be distributed as staking rewards.

This $MIX buyback program emphasizes the MixMarvel Foundation's dedication to ecosystem development and represents a significant advancement in its journey within the global Web3 gaming space. By reducing the circulating supply of $MIX tokens, the program aims to enhance their scarcity and increase market demand. This initiative reflects MixMarvel Foundation's commitment to creating greater value for token holders, giving back to the community's support, and fostering the ongoing development of the ecosystem.
