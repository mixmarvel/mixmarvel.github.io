MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in October 2020, the MixMarvel operation team gave rewards to community admin. 

From October 1 to October 30, MixMarvel gave rewards to community volunteers and thank them for their contributions (community management / translation/ PR) to community management.

Admins actively involved in MixMarvel communities and social channels, helping users to fully understand the MixMarvel project, play MixMarvel games and participate in MixMarvel activities. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of decentralized admin program. Admins who come from different countries will contribute different voices to MixMarvel that will help MixMarvel improve. 

The MixMarvel Foundation has a 30,000 overall back-up funding support for the Admin Program. This is a long-term program and MixMarvel has monthly budget on this program. The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, admin rewards and other administrative costs.
