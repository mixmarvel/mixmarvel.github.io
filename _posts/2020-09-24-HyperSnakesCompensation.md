subtitle: Community Operation

MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in September 2020, the MixMarvel operation team closed the server of HyperSnakes public chain version, and compensated users. 

MixMarvel, with its deep understanding of the blockchain game industry, aggregated resources has achieved great success with HyperSnakes. Users with certain previous behavior in the game were compensated. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem and the adjustment of its game portfolio. MixMarvel emphasizes on both supporting third-party games to transform into blockchain games and developing its own games. 

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this project. The funds will include but not limited to: Layer-2 technology support cost, operation and publishing costs; 263,692 MIX Tokens in total.
