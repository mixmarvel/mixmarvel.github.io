MixMarvel Foundation reported that in August 2023, MixMarvel presented new strategic alliance with ANTTIME, the trailblazers of the Time-to-Earn ecosystem.

ANTTIME stands out in the Web3 universe by providing a gamified TIME-FI experience where users transform their invaluable asset — time — into tangible rewards. 

By bridging the expertise of MixMarvel and ANTTIME, this collaboration aims to augment the way users interact, earn, and evolve within the metaverse.

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's collaboration with ANTTIME.  

The MixMarvel Foundation has an 15,488,867.38 MIX backup funding support for the development of global community.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
