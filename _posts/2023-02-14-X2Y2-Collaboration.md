MixMarvel Foundation reported that in January 2023, MixMarvel announced its partnership with the decentralized NFT marketplace X2Y2 to provide users on both sides with richer content experience and extra convenience in NFT-related trading, managing, and developing.

The content incubation platform and creators community MixMarvel has entered into a strategic partnership with the worldâ€™s largest decentralized NFT marketplace X2Y2 on Ethereum chain. This partnership will allow MixMarvel to fully leverage the multichain attributes of X2Y2 to pump up its ecosystem projects better. In the meantime, MixMarvel will also provide X2Y2 with continuous, high-quality game content and promote the exchange of community users by co-promoting its incubated projects with X2Y2.

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's collaboration with X2Y2.  

The MixMarvel Foundation has an 580,645.16 MIX backup funding support for the development of global community.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
