MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in July 2022, DeHeroGame Launches Technical Testing on Rangers Protocol Mainnet.

DeHeroGame, a blockchain game published by MixMarvel and the first application deployed on the Rangers Protocol network, has been running a technical test on the Rangers Protocol Mainnet from July 14th to July 28th.

DeHeroGame is a blockchain game with a heroic global fight as the background. Rich hero development and a combination of professions and skills train different heroes from various parallel worlds. Reasonably allocate different heroes to challenge nearly a hundred dungeon levels of varying difficulty and start an adventure in a different world.

MixMarvel, with its deep understanding of the blockchain game industry, aggregated resources and has achieved success with DeHero. A series of marketing promotions were conducted so that the product could be very popular all over the world. 

MixMarvel jointly promoted DeHero through global social media channels Youtube, Twitter, Telegram and world-renowned KOLs in July 2022. Through this marketing promotion, global users have a deeper understanding of the DeHero project.

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem. MixMarvel emphasizes on both supporting third-party games to transform into blockchain games and developing its own games. 

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this project. The funds will include but not limited to: technical assistance, operation and publishing costs 222,915.74 MIX Tokens in total.
