MixMarvel Foundation reported that in December 2022, MixMarvel announced that it has teamed up with Alchemy Pay, a convenient all-in-one payment system, to lower the transaction threshold and make fiat-crypto payment services more accessible to the community and beyond.

The partnership is expected to allow the MixMarvel community to purchase their desired crypto directly with preferred fiat payment methods, lower the threshold of fiat to crypto transactions, and attract potential traffic from the Web2 world. Meanwhile, MixMarvel will also infuse Alchemy Pay with a new user base, assist it in promoting service use, and inject fresh vitality into its payment system for mutual benefits.

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's collaboration with Alchemy Pay.  

The MixMarvel Foundation has an 3,229,461.76 MIX backup funding support for the development of global community.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
