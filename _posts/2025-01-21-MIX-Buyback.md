MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in January 21 2025, MixMarvel Foundation successfully completed the first round of the ​​MIX Token Buy back Program,repurchasing a total of ​252,674,870 MIX. This milestone marks a significant step in our commitment to enhancing the long-term value of the $MIX ecosystem.

The repurchased $MIX tokens will be allocated as follows: 70% will be incorporated into the Treasury to support future ecosystem development, while the remaining 30% will be distributed as staking rewards.

This $MIX buyback program emphasizes the MixMarvel Foundation's dedication to ecosystem development and represents a significant advancement in its journey within the global Web3 gaming space. By reducing the circulating supply of $MIX tokens, the program aims to enhance their scarcity and increase market demand. This initiative reflects MixMarvel Foundation's commitment to creating greater value for token holders, giving back to the community's support, and fostering the ongoing development of the ecosystem.
