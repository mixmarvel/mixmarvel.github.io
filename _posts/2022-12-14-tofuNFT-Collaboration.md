MixMarvel Foundation reported that in November 2022, MixMarvel reached strategic partnership with the multichain NFT marketplace tofuNFT, to provide users on both sides with richer quality content and more convenience in NFT-related trading, managing, and developing.

The content incubation platform and creators community MixMarvel has officially commenced a strategic collaboration with the worldâ€™s largest multichain NFT marketplace tofuNFT. This partnership will allow MixMarvel to fully leverage the multichain attributes of tofuNFT to better pump up its ecosystem projects. In the meantime, MixMarvel will also provide tofuNFT with continuous high quality game content and promote the exchange of community users by co-promoting its incubated projects with tofuNFT.

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's collaboration with tofuNFT.  

The MixMarvel Foundation has an 6,345,707.98 MIX backup funding support for the development of global community.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
