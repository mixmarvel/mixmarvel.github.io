MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in June 2020, the MixMarvel operation team closed the server of HyperSnakes public chain version. 

MixMarvel, with its deep understanding of the blockchain game industry, aggregated resources has achieved great success with HyperSnakes. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem and the adjustment of its game portfolio. MixMarvel emphasizes on both supporting third-party games to transform into blockchain games and developing its own games.
