MixMarvel Foundation reported that in December 2022, MixMarvel announced a strategic partnership with Myria, an Ethereum L2 scaling solution for blockchain games, to share valuable experience on blockchain gaming and launch cooperative efforts at NFT prosperity on both platforms.

Both MixMarvel and Myria see tremendous opportunities in the blockchain gaming industry and aspire to unleash the full potential of Web3 games in order to make them more accessible and acceptable to a wider market. MixMarvel and Myria plan to bring potential projects incubated by MixMarvel to the Myria NFT Marketplace. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's collaboration with Myria.  

The MixMarvel Foundation has an 2,873,330.64 MIX backup funding support for the development of global community.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
