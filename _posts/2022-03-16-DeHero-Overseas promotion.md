MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in February 2022, the MixMarvel held Valentine's Day-themed event for Dehero's global community and continued to promote global marketing for DeHero.  In addition, DeHero launched Valentine’s Day time-limited costumes and chocolate-colored “True Love Card Packs” to create a charming festive atmosphere.

MixMarvel, with its deep understanding of the blockchain game industry, aggregated resources and has achieved success with DeHero.  A series of marketing promotions were conducted so that the product could be very popular all over the world. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem. MixMarvel emphasizes on both supporting third-party games to transform into blockchain games and developing its own games. 

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this project. The funds will include but not limited to: technical assistance, operation and publishing costs 203,157.89 MIX Tokens in total.
