MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in June 2020, the MixMarvel operation team promoted  the official launch and maintenance of the mall.

Force For Fast is a car racing blockchain game incubated, invested, and published by MixMarvel. 

MixMarvel, with its deep understanding of the blockchain game industry, aggregated resources to help with Force For Fast's publishment of its various assets and game product. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem and the development of its game portfolio. MixMarvel emphasizes on both supporting third-party games to transform into blockchain games and developing its own games. 

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this project. The funds will include but not limited to: Layer-2 technology support cost, operation and publishing costs; 480,000 MIX Tokens in total.
