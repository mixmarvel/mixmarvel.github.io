title: MixMarvel Collaborated with GameBoy
subtitle: Global Expansion
---

MixMarvel Foundation reported that in November 2022, MixMarvel announced its new partnership with GameBoy, an aggregated platform for new-generation GameFi, to reimagine an ideal gaming platform and deliver a better user experience for both players and developers in the blockchain gaming industry.

The partnership of the two platforms doesnâ€™t happen simply because they can connect with each other as content incubators or publishers. It is much more about benefiting both sides in terms of exchanging resources, discovering bigger community pools, and broadening into new markets through co-promotion and in-depth collaboration.

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's collaboration with GameBoy.  

The MixMarvel Foundation has an 4,911,752.91 MIX backup funding support for the development of global community.  The funding includes activity costs to market the program, event costs, KOL rewards and other administrative costs.
